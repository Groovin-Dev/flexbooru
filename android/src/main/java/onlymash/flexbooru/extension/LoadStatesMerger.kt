/**
 * Converts the raw [CombinedLoadStates] [Flow] from [androidx.paging.PagingDataAdapter.loadStateFlow] into a new
 * [Flow] of [CombinedLoadStates] that track [CombinedLoadStates.mediator] states as they are
 * synchronously applied in the UI. Any [androidx.paging.LoadState.Loading] state triggered by [androidx.paging.RemoteMediator] will only
 * transition back to [androidx.paging.LoadState.NotLoading] after the fetched items have been synchronously shown in UI by a
 * successful [androidx.paging.PagingSource] load of type [androidx.paging.LoadType.REFRESH].
 *
 * Note: This class assumes that the [androidx.paging.RemoteMediator] implementation always invalidates
 * [androidx.paging.PagingSource] on a successful fetch, even if no data was modified (which Room does by default).
 * Using this class without this guarantee can cause [LoadState] to get indefinitely stuck as
 * [androidx.paging.LoadState.Loading] in cases where invalidation doesn't happen because the fetched network data represents
 * exactly what is already cached in DB.
